# 📖 Izram's Library – Python OOP Project

Welcome to **Izram's Library**, a simple Python-based library management system built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## 👨‍💻 Features

- 📚 Add as many books as you want  
- 🗑️ Remove any books you don’t need  
- 🔢 View the total number of books in your collection  
- 🚫 No data persistence – books are not saved after the program ends  

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. You’ll be asked to enter your name.
2. The program will greet you and display a feature list.
3. You can:
   - Add new books by typing their names.
   - Remove existing books.
   - View your current collection and the total count.

## 📎 Code Concepts Used

- Python classes and objects
- Constructors (`__init__`)
- Lists and basic list operations
- Loops and conditionals
- f-strings and formatted output
- Input/output handling

## 🧪 Sample Run

```bash
Enter your name: Izram
